# QML Remote Server

A Qt/QML-based server application that serves as a GUI frontend for embedded devices, exposing live properties through a standardized communication protocol.

## Purpose

This project enables embedded devices to expose their properties and state to a dynamic QML-based graphical interface. The server acts as a bridge between embedded systems and modern UI frameworks, allowing real-time visualization and control of device parameters without requiring the embedded device to handle complex GUI rendering.

### Key Features

- **Dynamic Property Discovery**: Automatically discovers and exposes QML properties for remote access
- **Real-time Updates**: Live synchronization of property values between embedded devices and GUI
- **Dual Communication**: Supports both serial (UART) and TCP/IP communication channels
- **SLIP Protocol**: Uses Serial Line Internet Protocol (RFC 1055) for reliable packet framing
- **Responsive Dashboard**: Modern, adaptive QML interface with smooth animations
- **Cross-platform**: Runs on Linux, Windows, and macOS

## High-Level Architecture

![High-Level Architecture](docs/architecture.png)

### Core Components

1. **GenericQMLBridge**: Central coordinator that:
   - Loads and manages QML files
   - Discovers QML properties dynamically
   - Handles communication protocols (Serial/TCP)
   - Processes incoming commands and updates properties

2. **SlipProcessor**: SLIP protocol implementation that:
   - Encodes/decodes data packets reliably
   - Handles escape sequences and framing
   - Ensures data integrity over unreliable channels

3. **QML Dashboard**: Example for responsive user interface that:
   - Displays live data with appropriate precision
   - Provides visual feedback and animations
   - Adapts to different screen sizes
   - Shows connection status and errors

## Usage

### Building the Project

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

### Running the Server

**For Serial Communication:**

```bash
./appqml-remoteserver examples/dashboard.qml --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --baudrate 115200
```

**For TCP Communication:**

```bash
./appqml-remoteserver examples/dashboard.qml --tcp 8080
```

### Testing with Python Client

```bash
cd examples
python3 test_dashboard.py --host localhost --port 8080
```

## Communication Protocol

The system uses a custom protocol over SLIP framing for reliable communication. See [PROTOCOL.md](docs/PROTOCOL.md) for detailed specification.

### Supported Property Types

- `bool`: Boolean values (ON/OFF states)
- `int`: Integer values (levels, counts)
- `float/double`: Floating-point values (temperatures, pressures)
- `string`: Text values (status messages)

## Use Cases

- **Industrial Automation**: Monitor PLCs, sensors, and actuators
- **IoT Dashboards**: Visualize sensor data from microcontrollers
- **Testing Equipment**: Control and monitor test instruments
- **Embedded Prototyping**: Rapid GUI development for embedded projects
- **Remote Monitoring**: Real-time visualization of distributed systems

## Requirements

- Qt 6.5+ with QML support
- CMake 3.16+
- C++17 compatible compiler
- Python 3.6+ (for test clients)
